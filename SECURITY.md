# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please use [GitHub's private vulnerability disclosure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

We will process your report as fast as we can, and respond within a week (although it may depend on the severity of your report).

This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
